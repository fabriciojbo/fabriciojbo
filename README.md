I am a highly focused technologist with a multidisciplinary skill set honed over 11+ years in the IT industry. I strive to build great products and can take an initial idea, tackle it from multiple angles and take it from something great to something incredible. With 11+ years of experience in various industries, I help tech startups from idea phase to high volumes.
